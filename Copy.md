Who We Are
-----------
We are a community of young programmers taking charge of our education.

Our Mission
-------------
Make Pitt a hacker utopia.

What We Do
-------------
We break down our pursuits into three areas: education, projects, and community building.

* Education: At our weekly meetings, we host talks that equip our members to become better programmers. We also host workshops every other week where we explore topics in greater depth.
* Projects: We encourage members to team up on side projects. We help by matching members with complementary skills and interests. When possible, we also provide financial support for project materials.
* Community Building: We want programmers of all backgrounds and skill levels to feel welcome in our community. We host social events where members can get to know each other. We also set aside time at meetings for mingling and town hall discussions. 

Inclusion
----------
Software development is widely seen as the province of straight white men. This not only disempowers underrepresented groups in computing, but also impoverishes technological development. We strive to make our club welcoming to all Pitt undergrads regardless of race, gender, faith, or sexual orientation.
