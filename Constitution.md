## <a name="i"></a>I) Name of Organization

Computer Science Club, also known as:
* CS Club
* CSC

## <a name="ii"></a>II) Acceptance and Compliance to Registration Requirements and Limitations

The Computer Science Club and its membership accept and will fully comply with the requirements and limitations of registration.

## <a name="iii"></a>III) Limits of Registration

Registered student organizations are student associations and are not official components of the University.  Registration does not permit a student organization to use or act in the name of the University, to represent the University, engage in any contractual obligation in the name of the University nor represent the organization as being an official part of the University.  Registered student organizations are permitted to have approved external affiliations.  Registration expressly permits registered student organizations to only operate on campus.  Off-campus activities of registered student organizations are the sole responsibility of the organization, officers and members, unless expressly approved in advance by the University.  Membership in a registered student organization and participation in its activities are voluntary and all risks of personal injury, property damage or other losses incidental to membership or participation in activities are assumed solely by the student organization and/or individual member(s) or participant(s).

## <a name="iv"></a>IV) Annual Re-registration

The Computer Science Club will submit its annual re-registration application during the re-registration period following the election of new officers.

The re-registration period is defined as being the week after the election of new officers.

## <a name="v"></a>V) Purpose

The Computer Science Club has been created as an extracurricular resource for Computer Science students and students of other majors interested in Computer Science. It is intended to provide supplemental education, opportunities for professional networking, and experience with non-scholastic projects. The goal of the Pitt CSC is to empower University of Pittsburgh students with the confidence and the agency to succeed during their time as students, as well as beyond graduation.

## <a name="vi"></a>VI) Activities

### Education

One of the biggest struggles for computer science students is the disparity between the material that is taught in class and what is needed in the workplace. The Computer Science Club hopes to bridge this gap in knowledge and provide a means for students to gain skills that they wouldn't learn in class through weekly presentations, created and performed by students, professors, and industry spokespeople, which will give attendees at least a basic level of knowledge on the presentation subject. Each of these presentations will be recorded or in some way be made available to all members of the club as references for future learning.  In addition, off-schedule workshops and company tours will be scheduled to allow students to learn more about technology around Pittsburgh.

### Networking

One of the main goals of the Computer Science Club is to provide a way for like-minded students to meet each other, with the hope of sharing ideas and collaborating on projects.  Often times, it is hard to know people that possess particular skills, so the club will provide an opportunity for students to get to know each other and learn what their peers' strengths and weaknesses are.  In addition, the club will provide a means for students to socialize and network with people in the computing industry in Pittsburgh and across the country through alumni and company connections, with the hope of helping students discover ideal future careers and even connect with potential employers.

### Experience

Lastly, practical experience is hard to come by, unless you have a focused way of achieving it. The Computer Science Club hopes to offer these opportunities to students through a couple of semester or year long projects, which club members will partake in based on their individual areas of interest and levels of experience.  Beginner students will collaborate with knowledgable ones, working together to build an open source project that will always be available to them as a testament to their skills and abilities; this not only provides them with valuable skills, but shows potential employers and friends they have a specific skillset.  In addition, the projects will stay under the ownership of the club, meaning that all of the code will remain to guide future learning.

## <a name="vii"></a>VII) Membership Requirements

1. Membership is open to currently enrolled Pitt students as defined herein.
2. All members must accept and comply with all of the requirements and limitations of registration as a condition of membership.
3. Membership in the Computer Science Club is voluntary and all risk of personal injury, property damage or other losses that occur incidental to membership or participation in activities are assumed solely by the student organization and/or individual member(s) or non-member participant(s).  Accordingly, the University of Pittsburgh, its officers and agents shall not be responsible nor liable for any claims or causes of action for damage or loss of property or personal injury of any kind or nature which may arise out of or are incidental to the conduct of any organization’s activities or that of any individual’s participation in any group-related activity.  it is further understood and agreed that it is the responsibility of the officers of the organization to assure that all of the organization’s members and non-member participants in all activities sponsored by the Computer Science Club are fully informed and advised of this ASSUMPTION OF RISK, and in the event any individual member or participant should express or indicate non-acceptance, the organization’s officers shall forbid participation and/or membership of such individual.  In regard to the organization member or non-member participant Assumption of Risk, the Computer Science Club acknowledges that the University recommends that the organization members and non-member participants make every effort to arrange for the acquisition of liability insurance sufficient to protect all participants against those risks being assumed.  For sport-related organizations, the University recommends that each individual have insurance sufficient to allow for any risks by participation, accident or by deficiencies in physical health.
4. No hazing or illegal discriminatory criteria for membership, including those listed in the University of Pittsburgh’s non-discrimination policy, will be used as a condition for membership in the organization.
